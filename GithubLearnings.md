# Github Learnings :octocat:

## What I've Learned :rocket:

### Git and GitHub
- Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS).
- GitHub is an online platform that provides interface for Git.
- Git helps track changes, collaborate, and maintain project history.

### GitHub Flow
- GitHub Flow is a lightweight workflow for experimenting and collaborating on projects.
- Cloning creates a local copy of a repository for easy syncing.
- Committing and pushing add changes to the remote repository.

### Markdown
- Markdown is a simple syntax for styling text on GitHub.
- It can be used to organize information and add visuals.

## What I'm Still Confused About

- I'm still a bit confused about branching and forking and when to use it effectively.
- I need more practice with pull requests and merging changes.

## Profile md file
- I have also created a profile Markdown file as suggested in the walkthrough

## Added this change outside the main branch
After pushing the MD file to main branch. Created a new dummy branch and made this change to reflect in the dummy branch. Once pushed, I will be creating a pull request to finish the assignment.

## Conclusion :tada:

I've made great progress in understanding the basics of GitHub, but there's still more to learn and explore. With time and practice, I'm confident I'll become a GitHub pro! :muscle:
